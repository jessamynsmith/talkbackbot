TalkBackBot
================================

Are you tired of "That's what she said" jokes? Then this bot is for you!
It will join a specified channel and respond to the configured trigger phrases
with what she really said, i.e. a quotation from a notable woman. It will also
respond to any direct message with a quotation.

I highly recommend both virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper to manage the
environments for your different python projects.

    # Create a virtualenv
    mkvirtualenv talkbackbot

    # Install requirements
    workon talkbackbot
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Copy settings.py.EXAMPLE to settings.py and edit to suit yourself
    cp settings.py.EXAMPLE settings.py
    vim settings.py

    # Run the bot
    twistd twsrs

    # Stop the bot
